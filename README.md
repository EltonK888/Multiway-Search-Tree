# Multiway Search Tree
Implementation of a Multiway Search Tree (MST)

For more information on multiway search trees, read http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~freedman/340/340notes/340multi.htm

Note for this implementation, each MSTNode only has 3 keys.

## Things I learned:
* Using recursion to traverse trees
* Understading and implementing BFS for MST
* Object oriented programming in Python
